SimpleDBus
==========


About
-----

SimpleDBus is a [Lua][1] library which enables you to write simple scripts to
interact with objects and act on signals from [DBus][2]. So far it can only do
method calls and listen for signals, but support for exporting objects and
sending signals is planned.

SimpleDBus implements a simple main loop based on the
`dbus_connection_read_write_dispatch()` call so scripts can only listen for
signals and make asynchronous method calls on one bus at a time.

Installation
------------

Get the sources and do

    make
    make PREFIX=/usr install

This will install the files `simpledbus.so` in `/usr/lib/lua/5.1` and
`SimpleDBus.lua` in `/usr/share/lua/5.1`. Have a look at the makefiles if this
isn't right for your system.

Make sure you have installed the dbus and expat libraries and their development
packages on systems where they are separate. The build process also requires
pkgconfig to set up paths for the dbus headers.

Instead of `make` you can use `make allinone` to compile all the code in one go.
This produces a slightly smaller library.

If you have set up [luarocks][3] just type `luarocks make` in the source
directory.

Usage
-----

Here is a sample script:

    -- import the module
    SimpleDBus = require 'SimpleDBus'

    -- initialise and get a handle for the session bus
    bus = assert(SimpleDBus.session_bus())

    -- connect to the client connected at org.freedesktop.DBus
    -- and get a proxy for the object /org/freedesktop/DBus
    DBus = assert(bus:auto_proxy('org.freedesktop.DBus', '/org/freedesktop/DBus'))

    -- call a method and print the results nicely
    print 'Connections to the session bus:'
    for i, s in ipairs(assert(DBus:ListNames())) do
        print('  ' .. i .. ': ' .. s)
    end

    -- register interest in the signal from the
    -- object /org/lua/SimpleDBus/Test implementing
    -- the interface org.lua.SimpleDBus.TestSignal
    -- called Signal
    bus:register_signal(
        '/org/lua/SimpleDBus/Test',
        'org.lua.SimpleDBus.TestSignal',
        'Signal',
        function(arg1)
            print('Signal: ' .. tostring(arg1))

            if arg1 == 'stop' then
                bus:stop()
            end
        end)

    -- now run the main loop and wait for signals to arrive
    assert(bus:run())

Use the command `dbus-send --session --type=signal /org/lua/SimpleDBus/Test org.lua.SimpleDBus.TestSignal.Signal string:stop` to stop this script in a nice way.
